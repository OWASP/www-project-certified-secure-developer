This project is aimed at:

2. Identify ways to get accreditation for the certificate - for example with PearsonVue or with CREST.
3. Look at ways to creating a question bank
4. Get all these items in one place
5. Look at costing

This project has been discussed in the Education and Training Committee meetings and the minutes of the meetings are available here:

### Road Map
The following tasks are planned to be run in parallel.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Refine the proposal for creation of OWASP Certified Secure Developer - 3 to 6 months.. that takes us from Dec 2024 to Mar 2025\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look at ways to get accreditation for the certificate - 3 to 6 months.. that takes us from Mar 2025 to Sept 2025\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create the curriculum for certification ... upto 6 months .. that takes us from April 2025 to Dec 2025 (give or take a few months)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Creation of question bank - 3 to 6 months.. that takes us from Sept 2025 to Jan 2026\

I am sure the timelines will change as we start executing the plan. But this is what it looks like at this point in time.
