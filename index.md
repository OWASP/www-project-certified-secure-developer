# OWASP Certified Secure Software Developer

Developing secure software starts with developers who can write code free of vulnerabilities. OWASP—focused on application security across web, mobile, low-/no-code, and infrastructure-as-code—is launching the OWASP Certified Secure-Software Developer (OCSD) program to help practitioners demonstrate real secure-coding ability.

OCSD is designed both for hiring managers who need a clear signal of security skills and for developers who want independent validation of their secure-coding competence. It emphasizes two core truths: writing secure code is not the same as testing with tools, and if developers don’t build security in, no one else will. The certification aims to define which security skills matter for application developers and to verify them in a practical, credible way. More details will follow.

## About this project

This is aimed at:

1. Refining the proposal to create a certification for developers - OWASP Certified Secure Developer
2. Identify ways to get accreditation for the certificate - for example with PearsonVue or with CREST.
3. Look at ways to creating a question bank
4. Get all these items in one place
5. Look at costing

## Minutes

This project has been discussed in the Education and Training Committee meetings. The minutes of the meetings are available here:

I am sure the timelines will change as we start executing the plan. But this is what it looks like at this point in time.
